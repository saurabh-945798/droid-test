          <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">Hello everyone, my name is Prakhar Singh, and I'm excited to be a part of this workshop on Blender. As a member of the Droid Club, I have been working with Blender for over a year now, creating 3D models and animations for various projects.

            In this workshop, I'll be covering the basics of 3D modeling and animation using Blender. We'll start with the user interface, learning how to navigate the various windows and tools. Then, we'll dive into modeling, where we'll learn how to create basic shapes, extrude and inset faces, and use modifiers to create more complex objects.
            
            From there, we'll move on to texturing, where we'll learn how to create and apply materials to our models. We'll also cover UV mapping, which is essential for creating more realistic textures.
            
            After we've created our models and added textures, we'll move on to lighting and rendering. We'll learn how to add different types of lights to our scene to achieve different lighting effects, and then we'll render our scenes to create beautiful images and animations
