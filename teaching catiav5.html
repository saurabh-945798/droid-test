            I am thrilled to announce that we are launching a new initiative to teach CATIA V5 to upcoming students. As we all know, CATIA V5 is a popular computer-aided design software used for creating 3D models, drawings, and assemblies of various mechanical and electrical systems. Being a leader in the industry, acquiring the skills to operate this software is essential for aspiring engineers and designers..</p>
