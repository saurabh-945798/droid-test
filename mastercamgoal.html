          <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">As a teaching faculty conducting a workshop on Mastercam, my aim would be to equip the students with the necessary skills and knowledge required to efficiently and effectively use the software for machining operations. The workshop would have the following goals:

             Introduction to Mastercam: The workshop will begin by introducing students to the basics of Mastercam and its interface. I would explain the various features and functions available and how to navigate through the software.
            
             2D Sketching and Modeling: The next phase of the workshop will focus on teaching students how to create 2D sketches and models using Mastercam. I would help students understand how to use the software's various drawing tools and how to create and edit 2D models.
            
             Toolpath Creation for Machining: The workshop will cover the essential aspects of toolpath creation for machining operations using Mastercam. This will include how to create efficient toolpaths for operations such as drilling, pocketing, contouring, surface roughing, and finishing..</p>
